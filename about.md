People, Things, Traces is a database I developed as my PhD thesis. It was created with Colonial Mexican painters in mind, but it can be expanded to consider any time or geography. The purpose of the conceptual model is to gather data about the connections between people, people and their things, and between things, but always keeping track of the sources where each piece of information comes from, hence 'traces'. At the same time, 'traces' evokes movement and space, which are also considered within this framework.
