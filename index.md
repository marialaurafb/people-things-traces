people-things-traces
People, Things, Traces is a database I developed as my PhD thesis. It was created with Colonial Mexican painters in mind, but it can be expanded to consider any time or geography. The purpose of the conceptual model is to gather data about the connections between people, people and their things, and between things, while always keeping track of the sources from which each piece of information originates, hence 'traces'. At the same time, 'traces' evokes movement and space, which are also considered within this framework.

These three elements have been a constant throughout my research as an art historian and digital humanist. This website hosts examples of my research in different fields, and traces of my thoughts while I do my work.
